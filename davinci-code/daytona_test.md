## Products & Services

Daytona offers a range of products and services centered around providing a secure and scalable infrastructure for running AI-generated code. Key offerings include:

*   **Secure Sandboxes:** Daytona provides isolated and ephemeral sandbox environments for executing AI-generated code. These sandboxes offer a secure and controlled environment, preventing malicious code from affecting the underlying infrastructure. Sandbox creation is exceptionally fast, with sub-90ms creation times from code to execution.

*   **Programmatic Control:** Daytona offers a comprehensive API for programmatic control over sandboxes. This API includes functionalities for file management, Git integration, language server protocol (LSP) support, and code execution. This allows developers to automate the creation, configuration, and management of sandboxes, enabling seamless integration with existing workflows.

    *   **File API:** Provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing files within the sandbox environment. Offers granular permission controls for enhanced security.
    *   **Git API:** Enables native Git operations within the sandbox, including cloning repositories, committing changes, and pushing updates. Secure credential handling is provided to protect sensitive information.
    *   **LSP Support:** Built-in Language Server Protocol (LSP) support provides features such as code completion, real-time analysis, and error detection for multiple programming languages.
    *   **Execute API:** Allows for the execution of code and commands within the isolated sandbox environment. Provides real-time output streaming for monitoring progress and debugging.

*   **AI-First Infrastructure:** Daytona is optimized for LLMs, AI agents, and AI evaluations. This includes features such as:

    *   **AI Evaluations:** Allows for scaling evaluations across parallel environments with reproducible snapshot states. This enables developers to thoroughly test and validate AI models in a controlled and consistent manner.
