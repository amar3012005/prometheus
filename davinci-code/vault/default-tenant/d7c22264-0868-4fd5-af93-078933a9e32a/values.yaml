      knowledge.md: "# History\nFerrari S.p.A. is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer\
        \ based in Maranello, Italy. Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939 as Auto Avio\
        \ Costruzioni, the company built machine tools and aircraft parts during World\
        \ War II. In 1947, it officially became Ferrari S.p.A. when it began manufacturing\
        \ race cars. The first Ferrari car, the 125 S, was launched that same year.\
        \ Ferrari quickly gained recognition in motorsports, particularly Formula\
        \ One, where it remains the oldest and most successful team.\n\nThroughout\
        \ the 1950s and 1960s, Ferrari expanded its road car production while continuing\
        \ its racing endeavors. Iconic models like the 250 GTO, 275 GTB, and Dino\
        \ 246 GT were introduced, establishing Ferrari as a symbol of luxury, performance,\
        \ and Italian design. Enzo Ferrari maintained tight control over the company\
        \ until his death in 1988.\n\nIn 1969, Fiat acquired a 50% stake in Ferrari,\
        \ increasing it to 90% in 1988. However, Ferrari retained its autonomy in\
        \ racing and road car development. Under Fiat's ownership, Ferrari continued\
        \ to produce high-performance sports cars, including the F40, 348, and 355.\
        \ In 2014, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) spun off Ferrari into a separate\
        \ publicly traded company, Ferrari N.V. Today, Ferrari is one of the most\
